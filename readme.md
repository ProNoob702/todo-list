### Start project locally

For both folders todo-list-api and todo-list-client

run `npm install` than run `npm start`


### Idea about project

For client project [todo-list-client] :
It was created using create-react-app (typescript template) , I did use tailwind as design library for my components

folders are like so :

- components : where i did put app components
- hooks : contains useTodoListMananger that handles todolist 
- layout : contain components that defines application layout
- models : some typescript models
- pages : contain the the code of different pages 
- redux store : where I did put the definition of redux store along with selectors and todolistSlice
- services : contain function that fetchs json data
- theme : where I did import tailwind stuff and set some custom styles

### Notes

- All components are functional components
